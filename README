# Biometric Authentication

A biometric identification framework. Provide unified DBus interface for
application layer, used for various biometric identification and authentication.

The framework is divided into three layers: service layer, core layer and
drive layer.

## Service Layer

The service layer uses the DBus bus to provide the upper application with
operation interfaces such as feature enroll, feature verify, feature identify,
feature search, feature delete, etc. Meanwhile, it also provides notification
of device status changes event and notification of USB device hotplug event.

## Core Layer

The core layer abstracts the common operation of all kinds of biometric
recognition, constructs the underlying framework of biometric recognition,
and provides the general function and unified data storage method.

## Driver Layer

The driver layer adapts various hardware, one driver corresponds to a kind
of hardware, and completes the hardware related characteristic operation.
